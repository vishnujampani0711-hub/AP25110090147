the program begins by asking the student’s name, registration number, and section to record the submission details.

it then takes the total number of employees, making sure it does not go above ten.

salaries of all employees are entered one by one and stored in an array.

a menu is displayed that lets the user choose different salary analysis options.

option one shows all the entered employee salaries clearly on the screen.

option two finds the sum of all salaries and calculates their average value.

option three identifies the maximum and minimum salary among the employees.

option four compares each salary with the average and counts who earns above or below it.

option five arranges the salaries in increasing order using the bubble sort method.

the menu keeps repeating until the user selects exit, and after every action, the student’s information is printed at the end.
